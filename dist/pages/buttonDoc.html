        <button id="push">Push</button>
        <p>One of the primary button settings, it contains a default color of green and it turns into an exact inverse color when you "push" down on it! It also has a very outstanding active state that lets the user know that the button is activated!</p>

        <button id="pull">Pull</button>
        <p>Another primary button setting, it is compromised of the default color of lilac and it turns into an exact inverse color when hovered over.  It is called "pull" due to it's topical similarity to the "push" option! It has the same active properties as push does.</p>
        <br>
        <button id="night">Night</button>
        <p>A primary button setting for any website's dark mode, which also lights up when hovered over. The active state is the same as previously mentioned!</p>
        <br>
